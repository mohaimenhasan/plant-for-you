# For My Amazing Girlfriend ‚ù§Ô∏è

I made this game especially for you because I believe in you so much. 

Computer science is challenging for everyone, even those who seem to have it all figured out. Every programmer feels lost sometimes, makes mistakes, and questions if they belong. That's not a sign that you don't fit in - it's actually proof that you're on the right path!

This little plant is a reminder that:

1. **Growth takes time** - Just like this plant needs daily care to flourish, your skills and confidence grow a little each day with practice and patience.

2. **Everyone starts somewhere** - Even the most brilliant CS students and developers were once complete beginners struggling with the basics.

3. **You absolutely belong** - Your perspective, your approach to problems, and your presence in CS is valuable and needed.

4. **Mistakes help you learn** - When your code breaks or concepts seem confusing, that's not failure - it's the exact process that makes you better.

5. **You are not alone** - I'm always here to listen and support you, and I hope this little game can be a daily reminder that you're capable of amazing things.

Take a few minutes each day to water your plant, do the daily affirmation, and maybe write in the journal. It might seem small, but these little moments of positive self-talk really do make a difference over time.

I'm so proud of you for pursuing CS despite the challenges. Your determination inspires me, and I can't wait to see your plant (and your confidence) grow!

With all my love,
Your Boyfriend üíö
